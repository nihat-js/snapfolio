    `"Time is something we often forget to think about, but it’s always in front of us. As the days pass, we realize that time never stops. Each day feels shorter than the last. Most people feel this way, but many don’t take it seriously. Instead, we focus on more urgent problems, like making money or figuring out how to get through the day. However, if we are wise, we can learn to manage our time better. Time is the one thing we can’t get back once it's gone. The good news is, by being careful with how we spend our time, we can use it more wisely. Every moment gives us a chance to grow, learn, and build the future we want. It’s never too late to start making better use of the time we have.`,
